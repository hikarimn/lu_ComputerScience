# Motivation of this page
As a person who goes to a liberal arts college (LAC), LAC students tend to be surrounded by less information about career development compared to those who go to big universities. This page aims to provide students at Lawrence with concrete, useful, and up-to-date resources. These are what I wish I knew when I was a freshman or a sophomore. The title says landing on an internship, but the preparation part is almost the same for landing on full-time job IMO. 
 The intended audiences of this page are those who hope to get into the Software Engineering.

#### Can I get an internship as an underclassman?
The companies do not necessarily target underclassmen for internship opportunities. Yet, there are tons of things that you can do to gain experience other than internships. I hear that starting early and applying to smaller companies can help you get an internship.

# Things to do before applying for a job or an internship
## 1. Getting experience
Before you start making a resume, you need to have some stuff to put on your resume!
The technical resumes usually have four sections - Education, Skills, Experience, and Projects. In this page, I would like to show some ways to fill the last two sections - **Experience and Projects**.

### Projects
It is standard that a resume for technical roles has a project section. The next three are things I recommend you include in your resume

#### a. Personal Project

I highly recommend starting this as soon as possible. I am emphasizing this because you can start personal projects from right now. Growing technical skills in an internship is a good plan but getting one technical internship can be hard if you have no prior experience in software development. <br/>
The project can start small, [a simple Java game](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/) or [a single webpage with HTML](https://coder-coder.com/how-to-make-simple-website-html/) for instance. It is a good practice to come up with some software solution to your daily issues. If you do not come up with a project idea, think about tools or languages that you hope to learn <br/> 

Here are some references 

* [What are the projects a first-year computer science student can do in the summer?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-projects-a-first-year-computer-science-student-can-do-in-the-summer)
* [24 Ultimate Data Science Projects to Boost Your Knowledge and Skills](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/)
* [How to Develop Project Ideas for Your UX Portfolio](https://uxmastery.com/how-to-develop-project-ideas-for-your-ux-portfolio/)

If you just started learning how to code and do not know where to start, following online tutorials is a good idea. You can find tutorial videos on YouTube(free) or Udemy ($10+ per course) <br/>

Here are some references
* [Web Development Courses on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/topic/web-development/)
* [Web Development Tutorial for Beginners (#1) - How to build webpages with HTML, CSS, JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JluqTojuME)
* [Introduction to Data Science with R - Data Analysis Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32o0DnuRjfg)

#### b. Course Project

You can call the stuff you made in the course as a project (IMO). For example, when you made a website front-end in Web Client Programming class, you can call it a project. If an assignment you completed in a course is tangible, you can call it a project (as far as you can explain what you accomplished in the project). For more information about classes at Lawrence, [this](https://github.com/hikarimn/lu_cs/blob/master/courses.md).

#### c. Hackathon
When you have time, go to Hackathon. It is a great place to learn new skills and tools, work on projects that you can put on a resume, and network with recruiters. Some hackathon covers a part of your traveling cost. Check out each hackathon's website for more info. Find nearby hackathons [here](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2019/events)


### Work Experience
#### a. On-Campus Organization
* Makerspace
* Women in Computer Science - I just started running from Fall 2019 Woohoo

#### b. On-Campus Employment
 They do recruiting in Spring Term, check [Handshake](https://lawrence.joinhandshake.com) regularly

 * Student Web Developer - IT - Web Dev. (PHP, frontend)
 * IT Assistant - IT - Probably more hardware maintenance(?)
 * Research Assistant - CS/Math faculty
 * Tech Crew - March - Probably more hardware maintenance(?)

## 2. Preparing a Resume

I first recommend you read [this guide on how to build a Rockstar resume](How_to_Write_a_Rockstar_Resume-2_by_22_Guide.pdf), especially page 14-18 on how to write effective bullets. Then, use [this guide by a software engineer](Resume_tips.pdf)
) to make it more tech industry specific. The latter guide is possibly the best guide for those who aim to be working in the tech industry. Also, [this email blog](https://2by22.blog) by a person who made the former guide helps learn how to _strategically_ go through recruiting. I highly recommend subscribing

## 3. Networking

#### Alumni 
When you find alumni who do interesting works, do reach out! LinkedIn, Voyager directory, Career Services are all useful tools to do so. Get their contact information and reach out. Ask for a coffee/phone call/email exchange to know more about them and their works. If possible, ask them about recruiting information they may know. Be respectful of their time and commitment!

#### Recruiters 
Recruiters can be a direct point of contact for companies. You can reach out to them at a career fair. After meeting, send emails and LinkedIn requests to the people you met. Ask if you can speak to them more about companies on call. Alternatively, you can send cold emails/messages. [This Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2054888934622756/) helps you find recruiters' email addresses

#### Community Organization
These communities help you connect to people with similar interests and informs you about what other students are doing in order to get more experience and to develop their careers. <br/>
I recently find [a spreadsheet that lists online communities around technology](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O97qjuCc6erLIcJiedPrsq3G9E2ECio_iltuF-YADtI/edit?usp=sharing) <br/>

##### Helpful FaceBook groups

# Timeline for getting an internship offer 

### Throughout year and especially during breaks

* [Participate in Hackathons](#c-hackathon)
* [Work on course/personal projects](#a-personal-project)

### Summer
(Summer after freshmen/sophomore/junior year)
* Get organized  <br/> Think about what roles and which companies you will apply for coming fall, make a spreadsheet to organize application status.
* [Make your resume perfect](#2-preparing-a-resume) <br/> If possible, try to have your resume reviewed by professionals
* [Network with alumni](#alumni)  <br/> If you are traveling to somewhere, network with alumni in the area. 
* Attend career fairs/company open house/webinar and [network with recruiters](#recruiters)  <br/> Find the nearby events to get to know recruiters and companies. If you are not in city, find webinars online where companies introduce their works. In my case, information about these come from [active communtiy organizations]( #community-organization).
* Work on your [personal projects](#a-personal-project)
* Study for [technical interviews](#preparing-for-technical-interviews)
* Get referrals <br/> I highly recommend getting a referral from someone worked/working in the company before applying for internships. Referrals make your application stand a little (a tiny little) out of candidates pool.  For me, most of my referrals come from members of [active communtiy organizations]( #community-organization). (Now you see the importance of getting into communities, right?)
* [August] Apply to internships in big companies. Big companies open their application for competitive positions in July to August

### Fall

* Apply to internships in big companies. <br/>For summer 2020, [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships/blob/master/README.md) lists a bunch of internships
* Follow up with recruiters when you do not hear back in 2 weeks after applying
* Attend career fair/hackathon/webinars (see [Summer section](#summer))
* Prepare for interviews <br/> Either it is an onsite or a phone call interview, research about companies and think about why you want to work for them beforehand. Prepare questions to ask to interviewers as well. Read Glassdoor reviews and talk to past interns to know the atmosphere of the interview. You can also ask to recruiters what they look to know more in the interivew (Do they look to know your technical skills? personalities?)
