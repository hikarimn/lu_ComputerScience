NOTE: The title says landing on internship, but most of the things are the same for landing on full-time job, I guess...  
ANOTHER NOTE: I am not an expert, but have went through internship recruiting twice. This article is about what I learned from that and what I wish I knew when I was a freshman or a sophomore.
THE OTHER NOTE: **[An important thing](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyvaynerchuk_in-my-20s-many-of-my-friends-were-more-successful-activity-6557380766710452224-T5jm)** to keep in mind</br>

Intended readers of this article are those who hope to get into one or more of following career fields:
 * Software Engineering
 * Product Management
 * Data Science

and those who go to liberal arts college (or small college) in rural part of country where no recruiters bother to visit. Also, if you just do not know what exacly you want to do but think Comptuer Science seem interesting, I recommend trying out stuff suggested under Software Engineering.

## Preparation
### Getting experiences
When you first think about applying for jobs, you need a resume, but before you start making a resume,
you need to have something to write on the resume, experiences. 
Here are the things you can do to gain more experience and put on your resume.

#### Personal Project
I highley recommend starting this as soon as possible. The project can be small, [a simple Java game](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/) or [a single page of webpage with HTML](https://coder-coder.com/how-to-make-simple-website-html/) for instance. 

#### Course Project
You can call stuff you made in course as a project. For example, when you made a website in Web Client Programming class, you can call it a project. When an ssignments you completed in a course is presentable, you can call it a project (You just need to be able to explain what you accomplished in the project).

#### On-campus Organization
* Makerspace
* Women in Computer Science - I will start running Fall 2019 Woohoo

#### On-campus Employment
Most of them do recruiting in Spring Term, watch out @ Handshake
* Student Web Developer - Web Development - a few students every year
* IT Assistant - IT - a few students every tear
* Tech Crew @ Warch - Some kind of engineer I guess
* Research Assistant @ CS/Math dept. - one every year

#### Hackathon

The type of experience you want to have varies depending on what career path you hope to go. For example, if you are interested in Data Science field, you can start searching "Data Scientist skills" in Google.


#### Course Review
See [this](https://github.com/hikarimn/luvista/blob/master/docs/courses.md)


### Resume/Coverletter
* [This pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10b9NZDhPbUOW_C7108IKe9ev6Ed2UG7F/view?usp=sharing) - Possibly the best guide for those who aim to be an engineer
* [This email blog](https://2by22.blog) by a person in Strategy&Analytics @ Linkedin - Learn how to _strategically_ go through recruiting

### Networking/Alumni/Recruiter Connection
#### Recruiters 
Go to career forum hosted by LU Career Services in Fall</br> 
After meeting, send emails and LinkedIn request to the people you met</br> 
Ask if you can speak to them more about companies on call</br>
Cold emails/messages may work
#### Alumni 
Use LinkedIn, Voyager directory, Career Services to find alumni who seem to be doing works of your interest, email to them </br>
Ask for a coffee/phone call/email exchange to know more about them and their works</br>
If possible, ask them about recruiting information they know
#### Organization
(Women in Tech) Be on their email lists
* https://rewritingthecode.org
* https://www.hiretechladies.com
* https://girlswhocode.com
* https://www.womentechmakers.com/membership
* https://www.witwisconsin.com
and many more

#### Career Fair/Conferences/Events
* https://www.xterns.com - A website listening tech/business/non-profits short-term events sponsored by variety of companies and organizations
* (Women in Tech) https://github.com/Ladies-Storm-Hackathons/GHC-Scholarships - A github repo listing scholarships information for [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org). Sometimes there are incorrect info, I recommend checking pull request/issues regulary and official company/organization websites
* HACKATHON! - A great opportunity to network with people including recruiters and to learn new tools (i.g., MadHacks @UWMadison)

### Interviews
* [This post](https://medium.com/@sophia.onion/software-engineer-job-search-resources-94206f03affb) by Lawrence CS alumna 
* https://leetcode.com
* [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) A book that has everything, does not a lot of questions imo, good for entry point (but physically heavy)

## Getting an internship
Start early!!!!

### Where to find postings
* [This Github repo](https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships/blob/master/README.md) for Summer 2020

(I will add more. Wait for it)
