The title says landing on internship, but preparation part is almost same for landing on full-time job imo. <br/>
As a person who goes to liberal arts college (LAC), LAC students tend to be surrounded by less information about career development compared to those who go to big universities. 
This website aims to provide students at Lawrence with concrete, useful, and up-to-date resources. These are what I wish I knew when I was a freshman or a sophomore.
<br/>
Intended audiences of this website are those who hope to get into one or more of following career fields:
 * Software Engineering
 * Product Management
 * Data Science

# Things to do before applying for a job or an internship
## Getting experience
Before you start making a resume, you need to have stuff to put on your resume!

### Projects
It is standard that a resume for technical roles has a project section. The next three are things I recommend you to include in your resume.

#### Personal Project
I highley recommend starting this as soon as possible. I am emphasizing this because you can start personal projects from right now. Growing technical skills in internship is a goog plan, but gettting one technical internship can be hard if you have no prior experience in software development.   <br/>
The project can start small, [a simple Java game](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/) or [a single page of webpage with HTML](https://coder-coder.com/how-to-make-simple-website-html/) for instance. It is a good practice to come up with some software solution to your daily issues. If you do not come up with a project idea, think about tools or languages that you hope to learn. <br/> 

Here are some references

* [How to Develop Project Ideas for Your UX Portfolio](https://uxmastery.com/how-to-develop-project-ideas-for-your-ux-portfolio/)


#### Course Project
You can call stuff you made in course as a project. For example, when you made a website front-end in Web Client Programming class, you can call it a project. If an assignment you completed in a course is tangible, you can call it a project (as far as you can explain what you accomplished in the project). For more information about classes at Lawrence, see [this](https://github.com/hikarimn/lu_cs/blob/master/courses.md).

#### Hackathon
When you have time, go to Hackathon. It is a great place to learn new skills and tools, work on projects that you can put on resume, and network with recruiters. Some hackathon covers a part of your traveling cost. Check out each hackathon's website for more info. Find nearby hackathons [here](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2019/events).


### Work Experience
#### On-campus Organization
* Makerspace
* Women in Computer Science - I plan to start running from Fall 2019 Woohoo

#### On-campus Employment
Most of them do recruiting in Spring Term, check Handshake regulary
| Title | Department | Notes | # of students hired /year |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Student Web Developer | IT | Web Dev. (PHP, frontend)| a few |
| IT Assistant| IT | IT | a few |
| Research Assistant | CS/Math fac. | Varies | zero or one |
| Tech Crew | Warch | Varies | a few |


## Preparing Resume
I first recommend you to read [this guide on how to build a rockstar resume](How_to_Write_a_Rockstar_Resume_2_by_22_Guide.pdf), especially page 14-18 on how to write effective bullets. Then, use [this guide by a software engineer](Resume_tips.pdf
) to make it more tech industry specific. The latter guide is possibly the best guide for those who aim to be working in tech industry. Also, [this email blog](https://2by22.blog) by a person who made the former guide is helpful for learn how to _strategically_ go through recruiting. I highly recommend to subscribe.

## Networking
This section is under an active edit.
#### Recruiters 
Go to career forum hosted by LU Career Services in Fall. After meeting, send emails and LinkedIn request to the people you met. Ask if you can speak to them more about companies on call. <br/>
Even cold emails/messages sometimes work. Don't know recruiters' email address? Check out this [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2054888934622756/).
#### Alumni 
Use LinkedIn, Voyager directory, Career Services to find alumni who seem to be doing works of your interest, email to them. Ask for a coffee/phone call/email exchange to know more about them and their works. If possible, ask them about recruiting information they know
#### Community Organization
(Women in Tech) Be on their email lists
* https://rewritingthecode.org
* https://www.hiretechladies.com
* https://girlswhocode.com
* https://www.womentechmakers.com/membership
* https://www.witwisconsin.com <br/>
and many more

#### Career Fair and other events
* [Externs.com](https://www.xterns.com) - A website listening tech/business/non-profits short-term events sponsored by variety of companies and organizations
* (Women in Tech) [A list of GHC Scholarships](https://github.com/Ladies-Storm-Hackathons/GHC-Scholarships) - A github repo listing scholarships information for [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org). Sometimes there are incorrect info, I recommend checking pull request/issues regulary and official company/organization websites
* [This super usuful website listing scholarhsip information for CS conferences](https://techlovers2020.github.io/Opportunities/)

### Preparing for Technical Interviews
* [This post](https://medium.com/@sophia.onion/software-engineer-job-search-resources-94206f03affb) by Lawrence CS alumna 
* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
* [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) - A book that has everything, does not a lot of questions imo, good for entry point (but physically heavy)

## Getting an internship offer 
(I will add more. Wait for it)<br/>
Start early!!!!
