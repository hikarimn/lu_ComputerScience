# Motivation of this webpage
As a person who goes to a liberal arts college (LAC), LAC students tend to be surrounded by less information about career development compared to those who go to big universities.
This website aims to provide students at Lawrence with concrete, useful, and up-to-date resources. These are what I wish I knew when I was a freshman or a sophomore. The title says landing on an internship, but preparation part is almost the same for landing on full-time job imo.  <br/>
Intended audiences of this website are those who hope to get into one or more of following career fields:
 * Software Engineering
 * Product Management
 * Data Science 

#### Note to freshmen and sophomores
The companies do not necessarily target underclassmen for internship opportunities. Yet, there are tons of things that you can do to gain experience other than internships. I hear that starting early and applying to smaller companies can help you get an internship.

#### Contributing to this page
Currently, I am activity editing content for this website. If you find useful information that you want to share, incorrect information or typo, please send a pull request. If you are not familiar with Github, just open an [Issue](https://github.com/hikarimn/lu_ComputerScience/issues).

# Things to do before applying for a job or an internship
## Getting experience
Before you start making a resume, you need to have stuff to put on your resume!

### Projects
It is standard that a resume for technical roles has a project section. The next three are things I recommend you to include in your resume.

#### Personal Project
I highly recommend starting this as soon as possible. I am emphasizing this because you can start personal projects from right now. Growing technical skills in an internship is a good plan, but getting one technical internship can be hard if you have no prior experience in software development.   <br/>
The project can start small, [a simple Java game](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/) or [a single webpage with HTML](https://coder-coder.com/how-to-make-simple-website-html/) for instance. It is a good practice to come up with some software solution to your daily issues. If you do not come up with a project idea, think about tools or languages that you hope to learn. <br/> 

Here are some references

* [How to Develop Project Ideas for Your UX Portfolio](https://uxmastery.com/how-to-develop-project-ideas-for-your-ux-portfolio/)


#### Course Project
You can call the stuff you made in course as a project. For example, when you made a website front-end in Web Client Programming class, you can call it a project. If an assignment you completed in a course is tangible, you can call it a project (as far as you can explain what you accomplished in the project). For more information about classes at Lawrence, see [this](https://github.com/hikarimn/lu_cs/blob/master/courses.md).

#### Hackathon
When you have time, go to Hackathon. It is a great place to learn new skills and tools, work on projects that you can put on a resume, and network with recruiters. Some hackathon covers a part of your traveling cost. Check out each hackathon's website for more info. Find nearby hackathons [here](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2019/events).

## Preparing a Resume
I first recommend you to read [this guide on how to build a rockstar resume](How_to_Write_a_Rockstar_Resume_2_by_22_Guide.pdf), especially page 14-18 on how to write effective bullets. Then, use [this guide by a software engineer](Resume_tips.pdf
) to make it more tech industry specific. The latter guide is possibly the best guide for those who aim to be working in the tech industry. Also, [this email blog](https://2by22.blog) by a person who made the former guide helps learn how to _strategically_ go through recruiting. I highly recommend subscribing.

## Networking
_This section is under an active edit._  <br/>

#### Alumni 
When you find alumni who do interesting works, do reach out! LinkedIn, Voyager directory, Career Services are all useful tools to do so. Get their contact information and reach out. Ask for a coffee/phone call/email exchange to know more about them and their works. If possible, ask them about recruiting information they know. If you are an F1 Visa holder, check out [LI Alumni Mentoring Program (LIAM)](https://www.lawrence.edu/students/international/current/li-alumni-mentoring-program-liam-)

#### Recruiters 
Recruiters can be a direct point of contact to companies. You can reach out to them at a career fair. After meeting, send emails and LinkedIn request to the people you met. Ask if you can speak to them more about companies on call. Alternatively, you can send cold emails/messages. [This Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2054888934622756/) helps you find recruiters' email addresses.

#### Community Organization
These communities helps you connect to people with similar interest and informs you about what other students are doing in order to get more experience and to develop their career. <br/>

### Preparing for Technical Interviews
* [This post](https://medium.com/@sophia.onion/software-engineer-job-search-resources-94206f03affb) by Lawrence CS alumna 
* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
* [Cracking The Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) - A book that has everything, does not a lot of questions imo, good for entry point (but physically heavy)

## Getting an internship offer 
Start preparing the above stuff as early as possible, especially if you are a sophomore or a foreign citizen trying to get an internship next summer. Internship online applications open in July or August for large companies. Smaller companies' ones open later. For summer 2020, [this Github repo](https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships/blob/master/README.md) lists a bunch of internships. You can also find openings on online job board such as LinkedIn or Indeed. Then, referral helps you land on the first interview, so try to get one from the networks you built. It is said that applying online is the least likely way to land on the first interview. Building connection with recruiters and contacting to recruiters after you submit your app helps your resume be read for sure. 
Once you schedule an interview, read Glassdoor reviews and talk to past interns to prepare for the potential interview questions.
